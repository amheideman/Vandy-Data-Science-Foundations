Project: Exploring relationship between Google Search Volume and Sales

Datasets:
* Google Search Volume Index -- provided by Nissan Global Search Interest Dashboard
     * Quantifies and indexes search volume by brand and model relative to other brands and models within the same time periods
* DHS Sales -- Nissan standard for sales reporting
     * Shows sales by brand and by model on a monthly basis
       
Key Questions:
* Is there a relationship between search volume and sales?
* What is the strength of the relationship?
* Is search volume predictive of sales?
* What is the lag?
* Future questions: How to external factors such as inventory shortages and more news related searches (recalls, randon Elon Musk news, etc) impact/strengthen/weaken the relationship?
